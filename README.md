# 09-Juicy-Breakout

I gave the game an 'electric' aesthetic, and created new sprites and particles 
effects to achieve this. I tried to implement sound using an audio player, but I couldn't
get it to work. 

Detroying bricks increases the 'charge' of the ball. When it hits the paddle when its
charge is great enough, it will play a discharge animation.
